# In order to make Tor Browser Bundle for Linux run successfully when
# extracted or copied onto a filesystem which does not support symbolic
# links (such as the FAT filesystem used on most USB sticks), all shared
# library symlinks in this directory were removed, and some shared
# libraries in this directory were renamed to match the names by which
# the loader will search for them.
# 
# Since the process of removing symlinks and renaming shared libraries
# loses some potentially important information about shared library
# version numbers, the remove-shared-lib-symlinks script which performs
# these operations records some information about its actions.
# 
# See build-scripts/remove-shared-lib-symlinks in torbrowser.git for
# more information.
# 
# This file contains a list of the rename (mv) and delete (rm) actions
# which the remove-shared-lib-symlinks script performed to remove shared
# library symlinks from this directory.
