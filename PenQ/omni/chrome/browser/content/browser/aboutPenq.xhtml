<p><span>PenQ is a free and open source Linux based penetration testing browser bundle from <a href="http://www.qburst.com" target="_blank">QBurst</a> built over Mozilla Firefox. It is pre configured with security tools for spidering, advanced web searching, fingerprinting, anonymous browsing, webserver scanning, fuzzing, report genertating and lots more.</span></p>
<p><span>PenQ has been built in a way that lets the security tester access the necessary system utilities right from his browser thus saving time and making the tests a lot faster.</span></p>
